# Ultimate Finance

Ultimate Finance is a Starknet-native BTC Yield Vault designed to help Bitcoin holders earn sustainable yield without exposure to lending defaults or custodial risk.

Instead of rehypothecation or undercollateralized lending, Ultimate Finance deploys BTC into transparent delta-neutral strategies such as funding rate capture and liquidity provisioning.
